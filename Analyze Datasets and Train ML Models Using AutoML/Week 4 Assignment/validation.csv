__label__0 "this was my favorite shirt before i ordered it .... i absolutely could n't wait to wear it . but i was so disappointed . at 5 ' 2 and 120 i have a athletic frame ... the small was tight in the shoulders but had so much extra fabric that i felt lost . i was n't wearing the shirt .... it was wearing me ."
__label__-1 "my conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened ! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized . but i also loved the design and ca n't resist anything with mustard yellow . i was instantly disappointed when i received it almost did n't even try it on . how can they possibly charge $ 185 for terrible itchy 80 's acrylic ? it looks cheap it feels cheap and it did n't even fit well . only redeeming quality : easily returnable !"
__label__0 "i liked the idea of this t-shirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple ; however i feel that it was overpriced for the quality . it 's a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale ."
__label__0 "i saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice . however the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small . also the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling .... i had to return this jacket ."
__label__0 "i like this top but it does not fit me correctly . i am 5 ' 1 and have a larger bust 34 c. this shirt fits in the length but is tight in the bust . i would have to buy this in a medium . i normally wear an xs or s. the quality is better than most t shirts and i ordered the red . the red is a deep and striking color and one of the better reds i 've seen this season . the biggest problem i had was the cut of the shirt . the top cuts in and does n't provide coverage my bras are not covered by this to"
__label__-1 "such a great dress . fit is flattering . the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd . classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes . thrilled with purchase !"
__label__0 "it 's not as form fitting & hour-glass shaped in real life as on the model . i think they must have clipped it in the small of her back so it does not look so boxy . otherwise it 's nice ."
__label__1 "this poncho is lovely . i found it fits perfectly . im 5 ' 4 125 and got the xs/s .. just long enough ( loke jacket length ) and the hood doesnt add extra weight ( doesnt drag it down the back ) . arm holes are approriate size . very cool piece for any weather layering ."
__label__0 "this dress looked like something i would wear and covet for years . unfortunately it was loose in the places where it should show shape and was tight in others . the bodice is incredibly small and not meant for bigger chested women . while the fabric is beautiful overall the dress did not look like much . disappointed ."

__label__1 "i love sweater knit dresses and this the first one i 've owned with a flare style that works . pattern placement is gorgeously done and is very slimming in a non-obvious way . i think the fabric is soft and warm . i wish the scoop neckline was a tad bit higher from a modesty standpoint . you may want to size down if you 're not busty . i am 5 ' 3 and m petite was the perfect length on me . shout out to the reno distribution center for getting this amazing dress to me in 1.5 days ? ! ? ! ? ! ! !"
__label__1 "dress is darling and well made . however it runs very large . i tried to size down but then it became a little short in xsp . would be great for taller slim women . the style is so cute . the online picture does not do it justice ."

__label__0 "i ca n't believe how small these are . i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly . these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them . the rise in the crotch is also very short . very full in the legs and one is longer than the other : ( the stripes do n't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price !"

__label__-1 "i had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself . i was very excited to get it as it is a beautiful coat online . however once i received it i was very disappointed . the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $ 168 and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with . i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well . perso"
__label__-1 "this dress fits awfully . it 's not short as pictured in photo . it hit just above my knees . it looked like sack . i would 've also felt like i was choking all night with it clasped around my neck . it potentially may look okay on someone who is very tall skinny and lanky but i have my doubts about that too ."
__label__0 "i ordered my normal size in this dress . i am 6 foot tall but the regular sizes were too large and too long ( mid-calf ) . i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline . the dress is lovely especially on the models in the pictures but did n't quite work out for me . also it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting on/taking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time !"
__label__-1 "i thought these pants were cute ! when i put them on they fit perfectly and were comfortable however i wore them for about 20 minutes and they were a completely different size and looked awful !"
__label__-1 "i am a sucker for a peasant dress . i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door but this dress is ridiculous . i look like a schoolmarm . the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory . i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly so i 'm bummed that this was n't what i expected . i knew it would have flow but it 's more billowy than i wanted . stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school ."
__label__0 "super large and a very weird cut . the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me ."
__label__0 "i wear a size 4 and i ordered the small for this top . it is huge and gave me a maternity-look that i was n't going for . i was hoping for a loose body-skimming fit as shown on the model in the picture but that was n't happening with this top ."
__label__-1 "totally see through ."
__label__1 "runs large under arms i am typically a size medium but bought size small ."
__label__-1 "i bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge . at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case . the fit is definitely sack-like as other reviewers mentioned . i had to return ."
__label__0 "the positive : light-weight fabric interesting drape the negative : i 'm tall and would have preferred if it was longer . the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons -- three fell off the first time i wore it ... and it fits loosely ! they 're held on by a single loop ... ugh ."
__label__1 "the fit on this dress is super flattering ! i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one . i am definitely a pear shape bigger on the bottom than the top . one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top . this is not often the case . i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it . i also love the colors . i bought the green and blue . i have worn it once"
__label__-1 "i 'll start by saying over the years i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer 's products . this dress represents all of my frustration . cheap cheap cheap material . low thread count . elastic ! ! ! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm . i mean this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown ."
__label__0 "after seeing this dress online and noticing how quickly it sold out i was curious about it but thought i was out of luck . it just so happened that i ran into the store and they had one returned in my size . i tried it and was n't sold . however i loved the color . it was snug across the shoulders and arms . the rest was somewhat flowy but boxy at the same time . i ended up bringing it home to think on it . after trying it on again i realized the snugness across the shoulder really caused the top t"
__label__1 "this dress was returned to my store and i was immediately drawn to it . i love absolutely anything with a full shape and this dress has it ! its cut like a circle ... so ladies this dress has a lot of fabric . i 'm 5 ' 8 and would n't be able to wear it as a dress but it made for an adorable tunic with leggings . the arms are a tad more fitted ( though i have larger arms ) which helped make the dress feel super cool and feminine . if you love a cool quirky piece this one is a winner !"
__label__-1 "i bought this dress in an xs and am 5 ' 4 115 lbs and fairly proportional . the shoulders were snug but the hips ( and maybe waist ) were at least 2-3x too big . comically so -- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side ."
__label__-1 "this nightgown looked so comfy and cute ! i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tight.i 'm 5 ' 3 and 150lbs . it was such a shame . size large should not just be really a medium !"
__label__-1 "i ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru . it 's true .. had to return it"
__label__1 "i love retailer sweaters ! always great quality and design this one is no exception . i have the navy blue one and it fits well true to size ."
__label__0 "while the cut drape and shape of this dress are very attractive seeing the fabric in person was disappointing to me . it 's clearly well-made and there are abundant high-quality details . however the combination of a large-ish pattern and the wrinkly thin cotton still felt kind of limp and cheap . i sent it back ."
__label__0 "this dress pattern and material are great - it 's just way too big . i even tried an xs and it looked like a huge sack on me . too bad it had some real potential ."
__label__1 "this dress is gorgeous in person soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets . it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing . i bought at size 6 which was two sizes smaller than my normal size 10 in retailer dresses . i have worn twice and each time 2 random strangers have complimented it . it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear . the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow . expensive maybe but well worth it ."
__label__0 "the print on this dress is really pretty and the styling with the lace is a nice touch . unfortunately it runs quite small in the bust so i had to return it . for someone that is small busted it will be quite cute . everywhere else it is true to size ."
__label__0 "the body is huge while the arms fit . being returned !"
__label__0 "i bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic but it was really huge on me . i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large . it was very long as well and i am 6 ' tall . i am normally a size 8 to give you an idea . i would recommend it but it is going back for me ."
__label__-1 "i bought two one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it . then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag ( in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry ) . it shrunk up 4 in the length and 2 in the width and now it does n't fit at all . also after one wear the buttons are coming off ( before i even put it in the wash ) and it 's covered in loose threads . the quality is just not there . i 'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on"

__label__1 "these shorts are perfect . not too short but can be cuffed so not too long either . the fabric is soft and gets even softer after washing . bought two colors in the late spring and then recently added to my hyphen shorts collection . you can dress them up or pair with a casual t and flip flops . note - if you like your shorts loose order true to size . they do stretch at the waist so if you want them to fit true to size order one-two sizes down ."
__label__1 "my stylist brought me the regular xs to try on in the store and almost told me i should buy it ... the length seemed just fine but i usually get petite so decided to order the xs petite before deciding ... good decision there is less fabric in the skirt so it seemed anyway so i am less overwhelmed buy the skirt . the cut is super flattering and length was actually better ( the longer sides hit me around the knee ) . i was n't sold on the dolor as i have pale skin but there is enough dark to com"

__label__1 "i love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large . i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber which i find holds up best over time . i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs . it fits perfectly ! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern ; so cute ! it is slightly short on my 5 ' 8 frame so the shirt tail hems peeked"
__label__-1 "i was very disappointed by the fit of this top . it is quite short ( especially in the back ) and very wide . i did not find it flattering . on a positive note the fabric is nice and thick - very warm layering piece for fall . for sizing reference i 'm 5 ' 5 '' 122 lbs and took my usual size xs ."
__label__1 "i 'm 5 ' 1 and 110 pounds and i ordered the 26 petite . the jeans are fabulous ... flattering .... comfortable ... i could go on and on . the fabric is super soft and the fit hugs in all the right places . it is a nice flare bottom . i will have to wear these with heels or wedges they are too long for flats ."
__label__1 "i love this jacket - can dress it up or dress it down . over a dress skirt or jeans . very soft and flattering !"
__label__1 "cute layered cami . great colors for summer or fall . very light fabric tends to get a bit staticy . shorter in the back than expected but a good versatile top"
__label__0 "the fabric and color of this dress is beautiful . two problems with the dress that the picture does not show . 1. it 's long . i 'm 5 ' 5 . this model must be over 6 feet tall as the length hit 5 inches above my ankle and that is not a flattering length . the other issue is that there is toile underneath making the skirt extra puffy . i 'm 42 and the puffiness reminded me of prom . color and fabric great . but had to send back ."
__label__0 "i do like this top . i bought the cream color and it is flattering but it is a little shear . i need to wear a cami underneath it . it also seems to be a little on the large side ."
__label__0 "i am undecided if i will keep this dress or not . i am 5/4 155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium . the medium was comically large on me with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance . but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic . the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person like a greenish copper . and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look . but the material is sheer so you would need to wear a slip and the elastic waist still has somewhat of"
__label__1 "this is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished ! it is not a cheap polyester fabric as one reviewer wrote . it is a rayon and nylon blend . it does wrinkle easily . i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back . i do n't typically gravitate toward warm color palette but the burnt orange color is really lovely . it can be dressed up or down very easily . and it has pockets ! i typically wear xs in retailer brands and the size 0 fit me well ."
__label__0 "i have a love-hate relationship with this dress . the fabric and print are beautiful but like most swing styles this dress does n't work if you 're curvy . tried on an xs in the store which was huge ordered an xxsp the length was perfect but the dress does nothing for a pear-shape . looks marginally better cinched in with the belt but i was lost in all the fabric and the skimming nature of the dress did nothing for me . as my boyfriend said that looks like something you 'd wear if you were pregnan"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress but i could n't . it ran large and heavy . rather than a sleek cocktail dress it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on . there was one upside : the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture ."
__label__0 "wish this worked for me ! i am 5 ' 9 '' . it is much shorter than it looks in the photo and the pockets did not hit my hips or torso in the right spot . the neck was kind of tight on me too . i love the idea of this dress but need it longer . the dress is very roomy overall ."
__label__0 "i ordered a large and it was skin tight if that 's the look you 're going for .."
__label__1 "wore for the 4th with white jeans super cute love the ruffle"
__label__-1 "what a shame this dress is . i wear xl and am 5 ' 2 but the dress in the store in the size xs ( ! ! ! ! ! ) looked just the right size . yup ! xs was just the right size . i ca n't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering . it would look like a sack . it is an inch or two too short in the front for me so i 'll be returning it ."
__label__-1 "i am not particularly large but i have thighs ! this pair of pants was totally unflattering ! my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps . i now understand why it 's on sale . you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged . but otherwise skip them . plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily . i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them ."
__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 3 and 120 lbs . i ordered a m and it was far too boxy and long in the arms as well as the back . the collar is small and lays flat . the material is good quality and soft but heavier than i had hoped ."

__label__-1 "hahaha .. this dress is hilarious ! it looks nothing like the image ! i am usually a 0/xs and 4 was the smallest size available so i ordered it . when i opened it it felt like 10 lbs of fabric . i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress . once i looked in the mirror i almost fell over laughing . the rest of the dress is huge . i do n't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone ."
__label__-1 "to be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down"
__label__-1 "material is too thin and quality is poor"
__label__1 "the patters/colors on this dress are much more stunning in person . it is lined and feels very well made . the pockets do n't add bulk to the hip area as many times they do which is great . the fit can be tricky if you have any semblance of curves . if you can try this one on in a store before buying . for reference : i am 5 ' 7 have broad shoulders am pear shaped ( i have hips and a good sized rear end ) 34b bust weigh 145 lbs . and generally wear a size 6 or 8 for tops and bottoms . the size 8 fit"
__label__0 "this fit well but the top was very see through . this never would have worked for me . i 'm glad i was able to try it on in the store and did n't order it online . with different fabric it would have been great ."
__label__1 "i bought one of these tees and i washed it a few times and luckily no holes yet like other reviews have stated . i just got a 2nd tee as they are quite comfy . i bought these both in-store but the petite size might have been better for my frame . i wish retailer would look into having petite sizes available in store and not just online . sometimes i do get lucky on finding petite sizes in-store but it 's usually from a return ."
__label__-1 "after reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model . the dress they sent me is not this dress . it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter like a cross . there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer . it was scoop and if you pulled it down the neck went up . the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here is rava . the length measured at 39 not the st"
__label__1 "if you happen to get a size that fits you you will love these leggings . they are true to size when the quality control works . i got 2 pair both in size 28 - one fits perfectly and the other fits like my mothers high waisted jeans ! the material is very soft and comfortable . also not sure who named these colors but the grey is really light purple and the dark grey is dark purple ."
__label__0 "i am a curvy size 8. i loved the colors but found it looked maternity when unbelted and there was too much bunchy fabric at the waist when tied . i tend to like things that emphasize my waist however ."
__label__-1 "i was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired . it fits tts length is fine ... the inside is some but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap ( kinda canvas feeling ? ) . the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way . it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm . this is definitely going back ."
__label__-1 "the wash on these jeans made my hips look twice as big . that in combination with the looser boyfriend cut was not flattering . quality was excellent . denim was thick with the right amount of stretch . unfortunately they had to go back ."
__label__-1 "weird fit and the tie just add to the problems . i think i 'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie . the tie seems like an after thought . it 's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size . i ordered a medium black and it 's already in the mail !"
__label__0 "this top is gorgeous : beautiful lace substantial fabric great color . but it looked so weird on me . i have broader shoulders and the sleeves did not drape on me like they do on the model they just stuck straight out . as another reviewer mentioned the fabric is stiff . i did n't want to size up because the body and length both fit well . perhaps if you have smaller/ rounded shoulders this top will hang better . for reference i 'm 5 ' 4 120 lbs and tried a size s ."

__label__1 "gorgeous dress . perfect for something special . paired with black heels . runs a touch large . i normally wear a small ( 5 ' 6 and 140 pounds ) but i 'm expecting so i sized up to a medium and it 's very roomy . the sleeves do cap out a little too much but it 's just so pretty i do n't care ! def a keeper ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress so badly . it came and the material is beautiful but when i put it on it fit so awkwardly . there was just no way to make it look good . maybe i needed a smaller size but oh well ."
__label__0 "the quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty . it just made me look super wide . i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist . it just was n't going to work for my body . maybe a different size would work but i do n't like it enough to try ."
__label__1 "this top is both cute and flattering . it is also soft and the colors are gorgeous . i highly recommend"
__label__1 "i love this shirt ! it 's such a beautiful striking color yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight . the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute . i bought another one of these when it went on sale . so now i have two just in case ; ) haha"
__label__-1 "i 'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful . the top is sheer but that 's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse . the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso ( not the chest but the mid-section ) is cut fairly wide . i 'm 5'10 140 # 34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit . i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect"
__label__1 "i am 5 ' 3 120 lbs and i got xs petite . it fits beautifully and hits me a couple inches above my ankle bone . as stated in my review title the material is quite heavy and great quality which helps it hang nicely . cut high enough under the armholes and snug enough under the arms and across the top of my chest so the fullness at the bottom is proportional . love it with my lace-up espadrilles !"
__label__1 "love this top i would have bought two but the grey is sold out in my size . very comfortable and true to size ."
__label__1 "i thought this was much more of an overall than a jumpsuit . after trying it on in a store ( must have been a return ) i could tell that the medium was snug and usually i am between a medium or a small . the straps were a little hard to manage . it is cute and i think cuter than on the model ."
__label__0 "this dress is cute and i will wear it to work . i only decided to keep it because i got the sale price and an additional 40 percent off . the print is cute but a little bit odd it 's a swimmer in a cap . the tie is fun ."

__label__0 "just so i 'm clear the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion but the bottom or waist . loved this romper when i saw it online it was however too big in the top portion . the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it gaps too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day . also b/c i 'm 5 ' 8 the small was just a tad too short definitely no bending ! i 'm 5 ' 8 tall 127lbs with an average size chest # 34c # i ordered a small and the bottom"
__label__1 "i love this top ! yes it is quite transparent but just needs a light colored cami ( i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer ) ! it 's incredibly soft and light for summer time . the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern . i also really like the sewn in v-neck line . it gives the shirt a more professional touch . i 'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer ."
__label__0 "after reading all the reviews i ordered up a size . the problem is n't that it runs small . it 's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size . or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size . the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect . unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws ( spare tire ) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso"

__label__-1 "i ordered a small and it is enormous ; i usually wear a size 10. it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler . also it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the 40s . i 'm sending it back ."
__label__1 "this dress is very lovely - ivory fits as pictured ( slightly below knee ) in ivory not as the black is depicted ( much shorter ) . fits a little larger than expected and material is very stretchy ."
__label__1 "i received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe ! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends . a great value if you 're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together . i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing ."
__label__1 "this dress i received is stylish comfortable and very nice to wear . i love the length goes just below the knee and i am 5 ' 2 so it is perfect for me . i ca n't say enough about this dress as i ca n't wear a lot of things because i am apple shaped but with this dress no one would ever know . thank you retailer for this beauty !"
__label__0 "i ordered this in a medium and although the details/design of the shirt were cute the swing did not work for me this time around . i typically like looser fitting tops but with this shirt i felt like there was just too much material and made me feel like i was wearing a tent ."
__label__0 "i took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print . it is mostly as pictured but because i have a larger chest the peplum did n't hit me in the right place . it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest . i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer which was disappointing considering the price . i returned it ."

( i am a 38b 5 ' 9 and have variable results with trying to order with the size charts . ) the large looked nice but was slightly too large in the chest . when directly compared to the medium it seems the major difference is the length -- the large was > 1 longer than the medium . i did not find either to be itchy and the construction seems totally ok ."
__label__-1 "this dress has a great shape and fabric - but the v neckline is too deep/low and the arm holes are also cut too low . would loved to have been able to keep it but had to return ."
__label__0 "i really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great . however the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy . i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft not my 5 ' 6 self ."

__label__0 "this dress is very pretty in person . it fits true to size and is very figure flattering . one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage . my only gripe with this dress is that it 's a little rough and stiff feeling . i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft . it probably works for most people but not for me so had to go back ."
__label__0 "this sweatshirt is very comfortable and the length of the sleeves is very generous ! the bodice is short so you may have to wear a camisole or tank top to avoid exposing your tummy . i usually purchase medium sized tops but had to return for an xl ! this runs very small ."

__label__0 "so the dress is interesting . has an asymmetrical wrap look short sexy length ( i 'm 5 ' 3 and the petite barely covers my assets ) and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed but looks sexy and plunging . but the shoulders are what make it look matronly . they 're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm . they show no shoulder at all which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish . i looked back"

__label__0 "in the photo and from far away this top looks more elegant than it truly is . wearing it feels like something better suited for sleeping in . it 's a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off and raw edges which looks rather cheap and sloppy ."
__label__0 "the styling of this top is really cute . it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look . my biggest complaint is the quality ! it 's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer . it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge it curls really badly . i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time . not worth the $ $ if paying full price ."
__label__1 "the quality of this vest is outstanding and the warmth is exceptional . i have worn it as a jacket on milder days in work as a warmth layer and brought on vacation to act as both plus a bathrobe . it is a very stylist piece that can be worn open or belted . it runs large by style but i am 5 ' 1 100 lbs and i can carry it off ."
__label__1 "i got these in gray and ultimately returned them only because i already have a similar pair of pants . they fit true to size and the quality is fantastic . i usually do poorly with pants that zip on the side because of my small frame but i had no problem with these at all . i may go after the other colors !"
__label__1 "just tried this on in store . the color in the photo is wayyyyy off . it 's a hunter green and dark navy zigzag . for maeve it runs large . i am usually a medium or a 10 and a s worked best . i 'm a 36d and there was no pull at the bust . will pick up when on sale ( bc a hundo for rayon is laughable ) ."
__label__0 "the top is really cute but it 's see through and the material does n't seem like the highest quality . definitely not worth the price ."
__label__1 "perfect except a little snug around the hips . very forgiving silhouette ."
__label__1 "i bought this cuz i wanted a plaid shirt that didnt have too much plaid .. this is true to size and adorable ! i will be wearing it out and not to bed or for lounge . adorable detailing on back and on shoulders ... its a keeper !"
__label__-1 "these pants looked worn washed & old looking when i received them ! the quality is super thin cotton as if it 's been washed a million times & is about to fall apart ! the workmanship is terrible . you can see loose stitching all over . the top portion is too tight & looks terrible stretched out . i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online ..."
__label__-1 "this dress was not what i had hoped ! from the online pictures i had high hopes but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap . the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress . needless to say it 's going back !"
__label__0 "i purchased these in a 26 petite and a 26 regular . the 26r was too long and bunched up terribly pass the knee . they were also loose in the waist and overall body . the 26p fit great in the waist and body however ; past the knee it was too tight and again it bunched but not as bad as the 26 reg . the overall quality of the jean seems fairly good . the fit just did not work for me so these go back and the hunt continues for white jeans . would love it if they made the hyphen jeans in white ."
__label__-1 "i saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely the perfect work dress . i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out so i visited another retailer and another to find it . unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me it seemed to overly accentuate it . i am 5 ' 9 a 36 dd size 12. the colors the fabric are all wonderful . but this dress is not for me ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to order this sweater . i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days . ordering it on sale made it all the better . however when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were with little definition . the sweater itself lacks definition as well just shapeless and hangy . i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on ."
__label__0 "as other reviewers have pointed out the bum is not flattering . the pockets are wide and the fit sort of flattens you out . bummer . literally . too bad i wanted these to work more than then coh 's parker cropped . the coh 's win . my wallet loses ."
__label__1 "i tried the gray pattern on in the store and it is very soft and pretty . the fabric has a nice drape to it . however the length was too long on me so i came online to find it in petite but most of the petite sizes are sold out in the gray . i shop at retailer because i like it that so many of their styles are available in petite however the petite length sizes seem to sell out much faster than the regular sizes . i hope retailer will give us short girls a break and order more petite length sizes so"
__label__1 "this is a beautiful top but it runs large . i am exchanging for one size smaller . it is worth the effort of exchanging ! well made beautiful lace ."
__label__1 "i was n't sure how the knotted front would look on me but it lays perfectly . very comfortable well-designed flattering top in lovely rich colors . i 'm normally a small-medium in retailer tops but i got the large as it does run small and i do n't like things too clingy . so best to try on in store rather than buy online . nice simple statement piece !"
__label__0 "i coveted this dress for so long but this was a case of the photo giving me a different visual impression than seeing it in real life . the gold patterns on top are n't shiny and delicate in person as i had imagined and they actually make a very strong impression up close ( and are painted on it seems ) . the mesh they lay on is also more coarse than i had hoped . the coolest part about this dress though is the shiny sequined black underlay . the photo does n't do that component justice . i was s"
__label__0 "i purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers . while the cut is fine the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through . will be returning it ."
__label__1 "love this dress . the fit is amazing . i wore it to church for my brother 's wedding and got so many compliments . it looks great in photos too !"
__label__-1 "when you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress the stripes are diagonal . however that is not the case with the dress in person . the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering . such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation . alas not very flattering so back it goes ."
__label__-1 "these fit around the waist but there is so much fabric and it poofs out and looks awful and bulky . no way ."
